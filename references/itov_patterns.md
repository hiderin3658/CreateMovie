## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: Too Vague

❌ **Bad**:
```
camera moves, things happen
```

✅ **Good**:
```
slow dolly forward, character turning to look at camera,
8 seconds, mysterious atmosphere building,
maintain first frame lighting and composition
```

### Mistake 2: Conflicting Instructions

❌ **Bad**:
```
static camera, fast pan, zooming in
```

✅ **Good**:
```
start static then slow zoom in over 8 seconds
```

### Mistake 3: Missing Duration

❌ **Bad**:
```
zoom in on character's face
```

✅ **Good**:
```
slow zoom in on character's face, 10 seconds
```

### Mistake 4: No Consistency Instruction

❌ **Bad**:
```
character walks forward, camera follows
```

✅ **Good**:
```
character walks forward, smooth tracking shot following,
8 seconds, maintain character in center frame throughout
```

### Mistake 5: Overcomplicating

❌ **Bad**:
```
camera dollies in while panning left and tilting up while zooming out
while character runs and jumps while spinning
```

✅ **Good**:
```
smooth tracking shot following character running,
6 seconds, dynamic action, maintain character in frame
```

## Testing Your Prompts

Before finalizing, ask:

1. **Is movement clear?** Can the AI understand what to do?
2. **Is duration appropriate?** Match to scene needs?
3. **Is mood specified?** Atmosphere clear?
4. **Are consistency instructions included?** First frame maintained?
5. **Is subject action defined?** What happens in the shot?
6. **Is it achievable?** Not too complex or contradictory?
7. **Does it serve the story?** Support narrative goals?

[movement] [subject], [duration], [mood], [consistency]
```

### Detailed Formula
```
[movement quality] [movement type], [subject action] [action quality],
